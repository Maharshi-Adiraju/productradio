# 📡 Transmission 4: Building Agents — From Pattern to Architecture

Every great heist starts with a crew. Every great agent starts with architecture.  
Muscle alone won’t win. Intelligence alone won’t last.  
What matters is coordination: memory, tools, reasoning, interface, and identity working together as a system.

Agents aren’t just smart. They’re structured.  
They don’t just respond. They operate.  
They don’t just think. They decide, act, and evolve.

This Transmission is about how to build agents not as clever monoliths but as modular, scalable architectures designed for impact.


## 🔑 Core Building Blocks
- **Memory**: What the agent remembers and personalizes.  
- **Tooling**: What the agent can use and orchestrate.  
- **Reasoning**: How the agent decides what to do.  
- **Interface**: How the agent communicates with users.  
- **Identity**: What the agent represents (brand, tone, role).  

Together, these form the **agentic stack**, the architecture beneath the interface.


## 🛠️ Evals & Error Analysis
Building agents isn’t just about design patterns. It’s about discipline in engineering.

- **Evals**: Start quick and dirty. Track ~20 examples to see where the agent fails.  
- **Error Analysis**: Trace outputs, identify low‑quality sources, and prioritize fixes.  
- **Component‑Level Evals**: Measure each step of a complex workflow — search, reasoning, tool invocation — and optimize individually.  

This is how you move from *intuition to evidence*. From *“it feels smart”* to *“it performs reliably.”*

## ⚙️ How to Address Problems
When agents misfire, you don’t throw them away. You tune and replace components:

- **Non‑LLM components**: Adjust parameters (date ranges, similarity thresholds, chunk sizes).  
- **LLM components**: Improve prompts, split steps, fine‑tune, or swap models.  
- **Optimization**: Parallelize tasks, use smaller models where possible, and manage token costs.  

This is **architecture in motion**; agents evolve as you refine their building blocks.

Building agents is like assembling a crew for a heist.  
Each member has a role: memory, tools, strategy, and voice.  
You don’t just need muscle. You need coordination.  
That’s how agents win — not by being smart, but by being structured for impact.


## 📌 The Takeaway
Agents are not monoliths. They’re **architectures in motion**.  
When you design them block by block and refine them with evals and error analysis, you don’t just build intelligence — you build systems that deliver outcomes.
