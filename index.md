# Hi, I am Maharshi Adiraju 👋

Great products come from **thinking like a business, building like a technologist, and leading with vision.**  
That guiding principle has shaped my journey from day one, influencing everything I do, from crafting strategy to scaling high‑impact AI‑powered solutions.

I focus on turning complex problems into scalable solutions, delivering AI‑powered products that drive business outcomes, unlock new value, and resonate with real users. I operate at the intersection of **technology, market insight, and cross‑functional execution**, aligning vision with action and strategy with delivery.

My approach is simple:
- **Understand the “why”**  
- **Own the “what”**  
- **Lead the “how”**

I bring clarity to ambiguity, momentum to teams, and structure to bold ideas.  
Passionate about building products that create lasting impact, I remain committed to leading with vision, agility, and a relentless focus on delivering measurable value.

# 🎙️ Welcome to Product Radio - my new experiment in product storytelling.

I started **Product Radio** to share the principles and practices that have guided me throughout my career.

Product Radio is my way of broadcasting those lessons, bringing together insights on AI, product strategy, and innovation in a format that’s simple, practical, and inspiring.

Through short broadcasts, frameworks, and stories, my goal is to help teams and leaders tune into the signals of innovation and build products that truly matter.
