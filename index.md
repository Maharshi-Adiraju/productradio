# 🎙️ Welcome to Product Radio

I started **Product Radio** to share the principles and practices that have guided me throughout my career:  
**think like a business, build like a technologist, and lead with vision.**

With over 11 years in product management, I’ve seen how clarity, creativity, and leadership can turn complex problems into scalable solutions. Product Radio is my way of broadcasting those lessons—bringing together insights on AI, product strategy, and innovation in a format that’s simple, practical, and inspiring.

Through short broadcasts, frameworks, and stories, my goal is to help teams and leaders tune into the signals of innovation and build products that truly matter.

👉 Follow along if you’re passionate about product leadership, AI-powered solutions, and shaping the future of how we build.
