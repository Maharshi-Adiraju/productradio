- 🔹 **The Timeline** → When exactly did patterns change? Was it gradual or sudden?  
- 🔹 **The Witnesses** → Which user segments behaved differently? Who was affected most?  
- 🔹 **The Motive** → Were there external forces, such as competitor moves or market shifts?  
- 🔹 **The Method** → Could internal changes, like pricing, UX tweaks, or messaging, have caused the shift?
