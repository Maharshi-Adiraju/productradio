# AI in Product Design ☕

AI in product design is like an espresso shot.  
**Strong. Fast. Inspiring.**  
But overdo it? You lose the flavor.

## ⚡ AI as a Game-Changer
- → Generate dozens of design variations in seconds  
- → Inspire new directions you wouldn’t have considered  
- → Accelerate the mundane, so you focus on the meaningful  

---

## ⚠️ The Catch
- → When creativity becomes too automated, originality suffers  
- → When decisions are driven by outputs, not insights, we drift  

---

## 👩‍🎨 Human-Centered Design
The best product design still comes from humans.  
AI is just there to **amplify, not override**.

---

## ☕ Closing Thought
Use it like espresso:  
→ A shot of energy, not your entire diet.
