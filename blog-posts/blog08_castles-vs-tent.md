# Stop Building Castles. Start with a Tent. ⛺🏰

But here’s the truth: **Perfection kills momentum.**

An MVP isn’t about cutting corners — it’s about cutting uncertainty.

## 🏗️ Shelter Analogy
Think of launching a product like building a shelter:  
- 🏗️ **A castle** takes years to build — by the time it’s ready, the world may have moved on.  
- ⛺ **A tent** gives instant shelter — quick, adaptable, tested in real conditions.

## ✅ What Makes a Successful MVP
- Validates real-world demand before over-investing  
- Refines based on actual user behavior — not assumptions  
- Saves resources by focusing on what truly matters

## 💡 Closing Thought
