# 🎯 Too Many Priorities? Give Everyone $100 and Watch What Happens

Ever sat in a meeting where every team insists their feature is top priority?  
- 🔹 Sales wants custom pricing  
- 🔹 Ops needs better admin tools  
- 🔹 Product wants analytics  
- 🔹 And of course — everyone wants it ASAP

## 💵 The $100 Test
Each stakeholder gets $100 to "buy" the features they want:  
- ✅ Want one badly? Spend $70  
- ✅ Think it’s a nice-to-have? Maybe drop $5  
- ✅ But that’s all you get — make it count!  

Suddenly...  
- ✔️ Trade-offs become real  
- ✔️ Priorities get sharp  
- ✔️ Stakeholders feel heard
