# Users Buy Outcomes, Not Features 🎯

Your users aren’t just personas — they’re people trying to get something done.

You don’t take a taxi because you love the ride.  
You take it to get somewhere: **fast, safe, and on time.**

## 🚀 The Real Value
In the same way, users don’t buy features — they buy **outcomes**.

#JTBD shifts focus from *who* the customer is to *what* they need.

## ✅ Breaking It Down
- Users don’t want **dark mode** → They want **eye comfort at night**  
- Users don’t need **faster checkout** → They want **less friction while buying**  
- Users don’t ask for **notifications** → They want **timely reminders to act**

## 💡 Closing Thought
Great PMs solve the **need**, not just the request.
