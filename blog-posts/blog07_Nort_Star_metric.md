## ⭐ Your Product’s Guiding Star
The **North Star Metric** isn’t just another KPI.  
It’s your product’s **guiding star**.

- 🌟 **With a North Star** → You cut through the noise, aligning every initiative to one clear goal

## 🔹 Examples from Top Companies
- **Spotify** → *Time spent listening* → Builds engagement & habit  
- **Airbnb** → *Nights booked* → Drives value for hosts & travelers  
- **WhatsApp** → *Messages sent* → Prioritizes frictionless communication
