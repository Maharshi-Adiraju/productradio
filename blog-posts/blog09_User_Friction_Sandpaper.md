# User Friction Is Like Sandpaper ✨

**Use it to shape, not scrape.**

Most of us treat friction like the enemy:  
“Smooth everything out. Remove all barriers.”

---

## 🔄 The Twist
Not all friction is bad.  
Some friction is designed to **shape better behavior**.

Like sandpaper, good friction polishes the experience:

- **Email verification** → Stops bots. Builds trust  
- **Double-confirm before delete** → Saves regrets  
- **Guided onboarding** → Boosts activation and retention  

---

## ⚖️ Good vs Bad Friction
- ❌ Bad friction → Annoys users and slows them down  
- ✅ Good friction → Adds just enough pause to help them succeed  

---

## 💡 Closing Thought
So next time someone says:  
“Let’s remove that step,” ask yourself:  

**Is it slowing users down or helping them move smarter?**
