# Hybrid Search: Finding the Best Burger 🍔

Imagine you’re looking for the best burger in town. You could:  
- 🍔 **Ask locals** → They name specific spots → *Sparse Search*  
- 🤔 **Read reviews** → You understand taste, vibe, quality → *Dense Search*  

---

## 🔹 AI-Powered Search
AI-powered search works by combining:
- 🔹 **Sparse Search** → Keyword matching  
- 🔹 **Dense Search** → Meaning & intent

## ⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Indexing the Web
Content is broken into small chunks and stored using:  
- **Sparse vectors** → Focus on exact terms  
- **Dense vectors** → Capture context & meaning  

### 2️⃣ Processing the Query
When you search, a hybrid search kicks in and fetches results using both sparse and dense methods.  

### 3️⃣ Smart Ranking
The two result sets are merged and re-ranked → Prioritizing relevance, not just match.  

### 4️⃣ Generating the Answer
Top-ranked results go into an AI model → You get a well-formed, accurate response, not just links.

## ✨ The Magic of Hybrid Search
You don’t just get matching words — you get **answers that understand what you really mean**.
