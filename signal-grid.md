Tune in and trace the frequency. Connect every signal in order, fill the grid exactly once, and complete the broadcast.

## How to play

- **Goal:** Connect numbers sequentially (1 → 2 → 3 …) and fill every cell once.
- **Moves:** Draw orthogonally (up, down, left, right). No diagonals.
- **Anchors:** **Start and end** points are fixed. Honor their positions.
- **Completion:** The grid must be fully covered with a single continuous path.

---

## Why this exists

- **Practice:** Turn product philosophy into a hands-on challenge.
- **Focus:** Train sequencing, constraint thinking, and clean execution.
- **Fun:** A light, replayable way to “tune into” Product Radio’s signals.

## Tips

- **Scan anchors:** Spot likely corridors and choke points first.
- **Work backward:** From the highest number to the nearest viable route.
- **Avoid islands:** Don’t isolate empty cells you can’t reach later.
