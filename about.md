# About

Great products come from **thinking like a business, building like a technologist, and leading with vision.**  
That principle has guided me throughout my career and now shapes **Product Radio**, a platform I created to broadcast insights on AI, product innovation, and leadership.

I am Maharshi Adiraju, a seasoned product manager. I’ve turned complex problems into scalable solutions, delivering AI-powered products that drive outcomes and resonate with real users. My approach is simple: **understand the "why," own the "what," and lead the "how."**

**Product Radio** is where I share those lessons through broadcasts that blend strategy, storytelling, and signals of innovation.
